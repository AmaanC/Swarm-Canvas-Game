Swarm
=================

The best description that I have for this game is:

*"It's like playing GTA with 5 stars"*

It's just a game that I thought would be fun. The readable.html file is the file that I wrote for the js13k competition in a hurry (*after* the deadline), so it has code written all together jumbled up. Now I'm rewriting it, and will probably be adding the [Clay.io](http://clay.io) API eventually.

Feedback would be appreciated!
